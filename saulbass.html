                Saul Bass was a major American graphic designer and filmmaker. He attended the Art Students League in Manhattan, where he would then go into design, film, and advertising in the 1940’s. He has collaborated with directors such as Alfred Hitchcock, Otto Preminger, Stanley Kubrick and many more. He opened up a new field for graphic designers with his groundbreaking work in the film industry, it should be noted that his work in the Music Industry and for corporate identity designs further consolidate Saul’s name as one of the best designers in the 20th Century. He has also won an oscar for best documentary for his short film: Why Man Creates (1968) 1.

                Saul Bass's Role In Graphic Design
            </div>
            <h3>Brand Identity</h3>
            <p>Saul Bass was a major graphic designer who worked for companies creating logos and typefaces, companies
                such
                as AT&T, United Airlines, Warner Communications.
            </p>

            <P>Saul Bass once said “The ideal trademark is one that is pushed to its utmost limits in terms of
                abstraction
                and ambiguity, yet is still readable. Trademarks are usually metaphors of one kind or another. And are,
                in a
                certain sense, thinking made visible.” - Saul Bass (2.)
            </p>
            <h4>AT&T</h4>
            <div class="atat">
                <img src="Images/Atat old.jpg">
                <img src="Images/atatnew.jpg">
            </div>
            <p>
                AT&T is a Holding company that comprises telecommunications and technological subsidiaries (4.) Before Saul Bass’s redesign AT&T’s logo used to be a bell, as a reference to the founder of the telephone Alexander Graham bell, We see here saul bass taking the original logo and transforming it into a simplified and recognisable logo, whilst taking from the original, this change occurred in 1969, The logo achieved a 93% Recognition rate in the United states, this is thanks to the logo’s new simplified look which was about visual communication. Blue was the new symbol of telecommunications and the future. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This logo was used until 1984 when Bass was hired to design their new logo. (5.) In 1984 the new AT&T logo was created and released, it was a globe that had lines circling inside of it, representing a symbol of a world circled by electronic communication. (6.) This helped modernise the AT&T brand as technology was advancing and this new logo helped communicate the brand message of AT&T which is “We connect people to greater possibility.” (7.)
            </p>
            <h4>Warner Communications</h4>
            <div class="warner">
                <img src="Images/warner.png">
            </div>
            <p> Warner Communications was an American media conglomerate which was established in February 1972, containing assets such as Warner Bros. Pictures, WMG (Warner Music Group), DC Comics and Mad magazine, however in the mid to late 1980s, Warner faced financial difficulties, Time INC. took advantage of this and announced that they were going to merge with Warner Communications in March, In early 1990, the combined companies were named Time Warner. The Warner Music Group continues to use the “Big W” logo which was Designed by Saul Bass in 1972. (8.) 

            </p>
            <p>
                The design of the Logo has been described as an electronic in character with a twisting cable-like form that helped convey the shared effort of Warner’s subdivisions, whether that would be in Music, Print, Publishing, Film Production and many more, The logo, helped provide a future-proof continuity to the company that was expanding and evolving (9.) Saul bass helped establish modernity with the logo by making it future proof as well as conveying the shared effort of the Warner subdivisions through the W imagery representing coherence with the brand.
            </p>
            <h3>Poster Design</h3>

            <p> Saul Bass designed unique posters that had simplifying powerful visuals, His ability to understand a film and then create a poster that not only represents that film but is also a work of art.
            </p>
            <h4>Anatomy of a Murder</h4>
            <div class="anatomy">
                <img src="Images/anatomy.jpg">
            </div>
            <p> Anatomy of a murder was a movie directed by infamous director Otto Preminger, with Saul Bass being tasked to design a poster for it, Reading through Saul Bass’s biography “A life in Design” Martin Scorsese describes the look of the poster perfectly:
            </p>

            <p>"Here's another emblematic image, instantly recognisable and intimately tied to the film. There's
                something
                lurid and garish about the black on red, which is perfectly keyed to the subject matter, then risqué, of
                Anatomy of a Murder, one of Preminger's best. And since the film is all about moral ambiguity and
                different
                points of view that never converge, it was brilliant to separate the corpse into seven pieces." - Martin
                Scorsese (10.)
            </p>

            <p>Saul creates a double meaning with this poster, showing anatomy of the dissection of the human body with the dissection of a body of evidence in the court. We see Saul’s fascination with the primitive, each part of the body looks as though it has been cut out by a novice, the hand lettering in various sizes and forms signifies inconsistency, every letter is different, just like in the movie, it is representative of the story which is about a lawyer who doubts his client’s story, Saul successfully explores the complex themes of anatomy of a murder and perfectly visualises it in the poster through its imagery, double meaning and ties to the film.
            </p>

            <h3>Album Covers</h3>
            <p> Saul Bass was one of the first freelance graphic designers to move into creating album covers. He designed covers for albums such as Tone Poems of Color by Frank Sinatra and Barber Shop Harmony by The Sportsmen Quartet (11.)

            </p>
            <div class="album">
                <img src="Images/albums.png">
            </div>
            <p>
                This is important as Saul Bass helped to push graphic design as a whole. It isn’t just posters or brand identity, it is an art form that helps the viewer understand something better. His work on the Tone Poems of Color helped the album stand out, and although he isn’t the first person to create an album cover, he did help the industry by inspiring other Graphic Designers to create album covers.

                    Influence on the Film Industry
                </div>
            </div>

            <p> Saul Bass was a pioneer in his work for the film industry, He created memorable and creative opening titles for directors such as Martin Scorsese, Alfred Hitchcock and Stanley Kubrick. His innovative approach with his movie titles helped to set the tone for the film. It should also be mentioned that his Wife Elaine helped with the movie title sequences as well.

            <h4>Casino</h4>

            <iframe class="casinovideo" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HMva00IO0zA"

                style='display: block; margin: 0 auto;'>

            </iframe>

            <p> The casino opening is spectacular. This is Saul Bass’s last work and it starts out with Robert DeNiro’s character Ace walking to his car, at that point a monologue starts talking about love and trust... Then suddenly an explosion! There is a car bomb, whilst depicting this explosion it shows Ace falling through the explosion transitioning to neon lights typically seen at casinos all while this cathartic opera music is playing. It continues to show extreme close ups of neon lights and LEDS, this continues for a bit until it shows Ace falling again with flames appearing in front of him, slowly fading to the start of the movie. 
            </p>

            <p> Screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi described it as "simply brilliant," adding, "I was so touched that they
                had
                understood the writing; that they knew what the film was trying to do. There must have been a hundred
                Hollywood films about Las Vegas that have tried to capture the essence of that city, but none quite like
                this. (12.)
            </p>

            <p> Saul described it by saying “Think of Dante's Inferno and Hieronymus Bosch, set against Bach's St.
                Matthew
                Passion, and you begin to get an impression of what we're after.” In Saul and Elaine's vision, Ace's
                body,
                or soul, rises and falls within a fiery Las Vegas purgatory. Between his ascent and descent, the flames
                dissolve into a montage of surreal neon lights that capture the city's throbbing assault on the senses.”
                In
                the sequence Aces character are like the strip of the casinos in Las Vegas, the title sequence is a work
                of
                visual poetry. There couldn’t be a more befitting finale for the greatest film title designer of the
                time,
                or a more moving ending to his collaboration with his wife Elaine. (12.)
            </p>
            <h4>Goodfellas</h4>

            <iframe class="goodfellas" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8C2caqaJPPM"
                title="Goodfellas (1990) | Opening Scene | HD BluRray 1080p" frameborder="0"

                style='display: block; margin: 0 auto;'>

            </iframe>

            <p> The opening for Goodfellas pulls the audience in, we can see Saul Bass using International Design style for the opening, with text of the actors name zooming by like a car with a whooshing car horn sound effect you’d hear on the motorway. then it cuts to a car with the three main characters inside of it, then they hear what they think is a flat tyre, so they decide to pull over and see what it is, they pull into a secluded area surrounded by trees and look at the boot of the car and hear the bumping, the main characters prepare themselves to do what needs to be done and open the boot, killing the barely alive man in the trunk. Then Ray Liotta’s character Henry Hill closes the boot and it freezes all while the quote “as far back as I can remember I always wanted to be a Gangster.” before playing some traditional pop with the Title card coming in with the movie title in red.
            </p>

            <p> The opening gets straight into it and the use of typography and design were done as Saul and Elaine Bass
                did
                not want to make it overwhelming and that’s actually a big part of Saul Bass’s work he believes in
                design
                principles and in this case the meaning of the opening scene is more important than the actual design.
                “Meaning over Embellishment”. (13.)
            </p>

            <p> The opening title sequence was resolved quickly partly due to Scorsese already having a particular
                approach
                in mind, partly because there were no backgrounds to be considered, only lettering. Scorsese wanted the
                sequence to reflect the fast and energetic pacing of the film hence the opening involving cold-blooded
                murder, Saul and Elaine were anxious not to overwhelm the act of murder so that is why they went for the
                International design style. (14.)
            </p>

            <h3>How Saul Bass has influenced Opening Movie titles today</h3>

            <p> Thanks to Saul Bass’s title sequences, it helped innovate the approach to set the stage for modern
                movies as
                a form of visual storytelling, A great example of the is the opening for Seven which was created by Kyle
                Cooper
            </p>
           
                <iframe class="Seven" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-BJkDyCdw0c"
                    title="Se7en (1995) title sequence" frameborder="0"
                    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                    referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen  style='display: block; margin: 0 auto;'>
                </iframe>
           
            <p> Here we can see through the eyes of the murderer preparing and writing his clues and letters for the
                detectives in Seven, from the opening is twisted and it reflects the tone of the movie, The way it has
                been
                shot and edited is reminiscent of Saul Bass’s work and Saul bass has helped to influence and inspire
                others
                to create opening movie sequences.
            </p>
            <h3>Film Consultancy</h3>
            <p> Saul Bass also occasionally worked as a film consultant for directors such as Martin Scorsese and Alfred
                Hitchcock, a good example of this would be the Psycho shower scene (15.) The shower scene in Alfred
                Hitchcock’s Psycho (1960) is one of the most iconic movie scenes in cinema history, constructed from
                over 70
                shots, the scene shows Marion Crane the supposed protagonist meeting the end by the cross-dressing
                murderer
                Norman Bates only 30 minutes into the movie. The transgressive violence and scenes nudity helped to make
                the
                scene stand out without actually showing it.  The scene frightened viewers when it came out and to this
                day
                it still has the power to shock.
            </p>

            <p> Psycho helped establish further Hitchcock as a director, In 1970 Saul bass who did the title sequence
                for
                Psycho claimed he directed the shower scene with his proof being his storyboard showing a sequence of
                images
                that are similar but not exactly the same as what ended up being in the final movie.
            </p>
            <div class="Story">
                <img src="Images/Storyboard.jpg">
            </div>
            <p> There has been a dispute over who actually directed this scene with Janet Leigh the actress in the
                shower
                scene stating” Saul Bass was there for the shooting, but he never directed me. Absolutely not. Saul Bass
                is
                brilliant, but he couldn’t have done the drawings had Mr. Hitchcock not discussed with him what he
                wanted to
                get. And you couldn’t have filmed the drawings. Why does there always have to be controversy?” it is a
                long
                controversy with Saul Bass and Alfred Hitchcock and I don’t really want to get into it, but it was a
                great
                collaboration and I can see both at work to create something impressive. (16.)

                Saul Bass had this ability to merge artistry with commercial needs, he understood the importance of appealing to the market whilst maintaining his artistic integrity, Saul Bass made sure that his designs were both visually stunning as well as commercially practical. (17.) An example of this would be Lawry’s Brand Identity which was created by Saul Bass 

            </div>

            <p> Despite being a small, family owned business, Lawry had gained success through its roast beef and other products like pre-packaged seasoning to customers and so they began to compete with the giants of the food industry when they started selling on store shelves, as they gained market traction, Lawry’s felt that their logo needed to be more contemporary that would work to launch further products into national/international markets and work well on packaging. Saul Bass was initially brought on to design the dressing bottles' structural design, however Saul became an influential factor in the decision to develop a new logo and then they went on to develop brand guidelines for the company.

            <h3>Legacy and Influence</h3>
            <p> Saul Bass has been a very influential designer, his minimalist style and emphasis on visual storytelling
                has
                helped influence further generations of graphic designers. His innovation and techniques have helped set
                new
                standards for film branding, and current designers still draw inspiration from his work, His work
                continues
                to
                inspire new talent in graphic design and filmmaking with his ability to show complex narratives through
                simple
                storyboards and visuals which serves as a blueprint for other artists who are hoping to make their mark
                as a
                designer (20.) Bass has proved that contemporary art does not have to be ornate or necessarily
                eye-catching,
                minimalism and adaptability can go a long way instead.
            </p>
            <h3>Modernity</h3>
            <p> Saul bass has had his legacy continued through various artists in TV Film Art etc. it just goes to show
                how
                influential he has been as a designer, Here are two examples of inspiration in Popular Film and TV.

            <h4>Monsters Inc</h4>
            
                <iframe class="Monster" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vFgYu5AU4-A"

            <p> The Monsters Inc opening title sequence is created by Geefwee Boedoe, the sequence is reminiscent of
                Saul
                Bass’s
                work for Around the world in eighty days and it's a Mad Mad Mad Mad world, the sequence is charming with
                the
                cut-out shapes and hand-drawn typography which bears a imperfection that is inviting to the viewer
                whilst
                removing any discomfort that a young viewer may feel after watching the slightly sinister opening scene,
                the
                title sequence helps reinforce that it is a comedy. (20.)
            </p>
            <h4>Mad Men</h4>
        
                <iframe class="mad" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wHNVxRaHprw"
                    title="Mad Men | Opening Credits / Intro | AMC" frameborder="0"
                    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                    referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen  style='display: block; margin: 0 auto;'>
                </iframe>
            
            <p> The opening for Mad Men is a stark contrast in terms of design and tone compared to Monster Inc.
                Designed by
                Jeremy Cox and creatively directed by Steve Fuller and Mark Gardner , the opening title features a
                shadowed
                figure entering his office, setting down his briefcase, then his room collapsing around him. Then it
                shows
                the
                figure falling through diamond rings, happy families, women in underwear, He is falling through the
                advertising
                of the 50’s. (21.)
            </p>

            <p> When Interviewed Steve Fuller had this to say “If you’re going to do something with illustration and a
                black
                silhouetted figure, you need to counteract that in order to keep it looking like a cartoon. We’ve seen
                stuff
                go
                badly because people misuse the camera in 3D. I’m a huge Saul Bass fan, but Matthew Weiner said, “I
                don’t
                want
                it to look like the ’60s.” I like to think that it’s kind of an update of Saul Bass.” The Mad Men title
                is
                an
                homage to Saul bass and his work whilst expanding upon it. (21.)
