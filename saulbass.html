    <div class="Introduction">
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p> Saul Bass was a major American graphic designer and filmmaker, he attended the art students league in
            Manhattan which he would then go onto design, film and advertising in the 1940’s. He has collaborated with
            directors such as Alfred Hitchcock, Otto Preminger, Stanley Kubrick and many more, He opened up a new field
            for graphic designers with his ground-breaking work in the film industry, it should also be noted that his
            work in the Music Industry and for corporate identity designs further consolidate Saul’s name as one of the
            new breed of designers in the 20th Century. He has also won an Oscar for best documentary for his short
            film: Why Man Creates (1968) 1.
        </p>
        <p> Saul Bass is important as a graphic designer thanks to his interesting approach to design, his influence in
            the film industry, his impact on graphic design, visual storytelling and brand identity. All this and more
            will be covered in this essay: Why is Saul Bass so Important?
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="Graphic Design">
        <h1>Saul Bass's Role In Graphic Design</h1>
        <h3>Brand Identity</h3>
        <p>Saul Bass was a major graphic designer who worked for companies creating logos and typefaces, companies such
            as AT&T, United Airlines, Warner Communications.
        </p>

        <P>Saul Bass once said “The ideal trademark is one that is pushed to its utmost limits in terms of abstraction
            and ambiguity, yet is still readable. Trademarks are usually metaphors of one kind or another. And are, in a
            certain sense, thinking made visible.” - Saul Bass (2.)
        </p>
        <h4>AT&T</h4>
        <p>
            AT&T is a Holding company that comprises telecommunications and technological subsidiaries (4.) Before Saul
            Bass’s redesign AT&T’s logo used to be a bell as a reference to the founder of the telephone Alexander
            Graham bell, We see here saul bass taking the original logo and transforming it into a simplified and
            recognisable logo, whilst taking from the original, this change occurred in 1969, The logo achieved a 93%
            Recognition rate in the United states thanks to the simplicity, this is thanks to the logo’s new look which
            was about visual communication, blue was the new symbol of telecommunications and the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            This logo was used until 1984 when Bass was hired to design their new logo (5.) In 1984 the new AT&T logo
            was created and released, it was a globe that had lines circling inside of it representing a symbol of a
            world circled by electronic communication. (6.) This helped modernise the AT&T brand as technology was
            advancing and this new logo helped communicate the brand message of AT&T which is “We connect people to
            greater possibility.” (7.)
        </p>
        <h4>Warner Communications</h4>
        <p>Warner Communications was an American media conglomerate which was established in February 1972, containing
            assets such as Warner Bros. Pictures, WMG (Warner Music Group), DC Comics and Mad magazine, however in the
            mid to late 1980s, Warner faced financial difficulties, Time INC. took advantage of this and announced that
            they were going to merge with Warner Communications in March, In early 1990, the combined companies were
            named Time Warner, The Warner Music Group continues to use the “Big W” logo which was Designed by Saul Bass
            in 1972. (8.)
        </p>
        <p>The design of the Logo has been described as an electronic in character with a twisting cable-like form that
            helped convey the shared effort of Warner’s subdivisions whether that would be in Music, Print, Publishing,
            Film Production and much more, The logo, helped provide a future-proof continuity to the company that was
            expanding and evolving (9.) Saul bass helped establish modernity with the logo by making it future proof as
            well as conveying the shared effort of the Warner subdivisions through the imagery representing coherence
            with the brand.
        </p>
        <h3>Poster Design</h3>
        <p> Saul Bass designed unique posters that had simplifying powerful visuals,
            His ability to understand a film and then create a poster that not only
            represents that film but is a work of art.
        </p>
        <h4>Anatomy of a Murder</h4>
        <p> Anatomy of a murder was a movie directed by infamous director Otto Preminger’s with Saul Bass being tasked
            to
            design a post for it, Reading through Saul Bass “A life in Design” Martin Scorsese describes the look of the
            poster perfectly:
        </p>

        <p>"Here's another emblematic image, instantly recognisable and intimately tied to the film. There's something
            lurid and garish about the black on red, which is perfectly keyed to the subject matter, then risqué, of
            Anatomy of a Murder, one of Preminger's best. And since the film is all about moral ambiguity and different
            points of view that never converge, it was brilliant to separate the corpse into seven pieces." - Martin
            Scorsese (10.)
        </p>

        <p>Saul’s creates a double meaning with this poster, showing anatomy of the dissection of the human body with
            the dissection of a body of evidence in the court. We see Saul’s fascination with the primitive, each part
            of the body looks as though it has been cut out by a novice, the hand lettering in various sizes and forms
            signifies inconsistency, every letter is different, just like in the movie, it is representative of the
            story which is about a lawyer who doubts his client’s story, Saul successfully explores the complex themes
            of anatomy of a murder and perfectly visualises it in the poster through its imagery, double meaning and
            ties to the film. 
        </p>

        <h3>Album Covers</h3>
        <p> Saul Bass was one of the first freelance graphic designers to move into creating cover design, He designed
            covers for albums such as Tone Poems of Color by Frank Sinatra and, Barber Shop Harmony by The Sportsmen
            Quartet (11.)

        </p>
        <p>
            This is important as Saul Bass helped to really push graphic design as whole, It isn’t just posters or brand
            identity, it is an art form that helps the viewer understand something better, His work on the Tone Poems of
            Color help the album stand out although he isn’t the first person to create an album cover, he did help the
            industry by inspiring other Graphic Designers to create album covers.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="Film">
        <h1>Influence on the Film Industry</h1>

        <p> Saul Bass was a pioneer in his work for the film industry, He created the memorable and creative opening
            titles for directors such as Martin Scorsese, Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, his innovative approach
            with his movie titles helped to set the tone for the film. It should also be mentioned that his Wife Elaine
            helped with the movie title sequences as well.
        </p>
        <h4>Casino</h4>

        <p> The casino opening is crazy, this is Saul Bass’s last work and it starts out with Robert DeNiro’s character
            Ace walking to his car, then it has a monologue about love and trust then an explosion, there is a car bomb,
            then whilst depicting this explosion it shows sam falling through the explosion transitioning to neon lights
            typically seen at casinos all while this cathartic opera music is playing. It then continues to show extreme
            close ups of neon lights and LEDS depicting the cast and crew who worked on this movie, this continues for a
            bit until it shows Ace falling again with flames appearing in front of him, slowly fading to the start of
            the movie.
        </p>

        <p> Screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi described it as "simply brilliant," adding, "I was so touched that they had
            understood the writing; that they knew what the film was trying to do. There must have been a hundred
            Hollywood films about Las Vegas that have tried to capture the essence of that city, but none quite like
            this. (12.)
        </p>

        <p> Saul described it by saying “Think of Dante's Inferno and Hieronymus Bosch, set against Bach's St. Matthew
            Passion, and you begin to get an impression of what we're after.” In Saul and Elaine's vision, Ace's body,
            or soul, rises and falls within a fiery Las Vegas purgatory. Between his ascent and descent, the flames
            dissolve into a montage of surreal neon lights that capture the city's throbbing assault on the senses.” In
            the sequence Aces character are like the strip of the casinos in Las Vegas, the title sequence is a work of
            visual poetry. There couldn’t be a more befitting finale for the greatest film title designer of the time,
            or a more moving ending to his collaboration with his wife Elaine. (12.)
        </p>
        <h4>Goodfellas</h4>
        <p> The opening for Goodfellas pulls the audience in, we can see Saul Bass using International Design style for
            the opening, with text of the actors name zooming by like a car with a whooshing car horn sound effect you’d
            hear on the motorway. then it cuts to a car with the three main characters inside of it, they're all very
            tired, then they hear what they think is a flat tyre, so they decide to pull over and see what it is, they
            pull into a secluded area surrounded by trees and look at the boot of the car and hear the bumping, the main
            characters prepare themselves to do what needs to be done and open the boot, killing the barely alive man in
            the trunk. Then Ray Liotta’s character Henry Hill closes the boot and it freezes all while the quote “as far
            back as I can remember I always wanted to be a Gangster.” before playing some traditional pop with the Title
            card coming in with the movie title in red.
        </p>

        <p> The opening gets straight into it and the use of typography and design were done as Saul and Elaine Bass did
            not want to make it overwhelming and that’s actually a big part of Saul Bass’s work he believes in design
            principles and in this case the meaning of the opening scene is more important than the actual design.
            “Meaning over Embellishment”. (13.)
        </p>

        <p> The opening title sequence was resolved quickly partly due to Scorsese already having a particular approach
            in mind, partly because there were no backgrounds to be considered, only lettering. Scorsese wanted the
            sequence to reflect the fast and energetic pacing of the film hence the opening involving cold-blooded
            murder, Saul and Elaine were anxious not to overwhelm the act of murder so that is why they went for the
            International design style. (14.)
        </p>

        <h3>How Saul Bass has influenced Opening Movie titles today</h3>

        <p> Thanks to Saul Bass’s title sequences, it helped innovate the approach to set the stage for modern movies as
            a form of visual storytelling, A great example of the is the opening for Seven which was created by Kyle
            Cooper
        </p>
        <p> Here we can see through the eyes of the murderer preparing and writing his clues and letters for the
            detectives in Seven, from the opening is twisted and it reflects the tone of the movie, The way it has been
            shot and edited is reminiscent of Saul Bass’s work and Saul bass has helped to influence and inspire others
            to create opening movie sequences.
        </p>
        <h3>Film Consultancy</h3>
        <p> Saul Bass also occasionally worked as a film consultant for directors such as Martin Scorsese and Alfred
            Hitchcock, a good example of this would be the Psycho shower scene (15.) The shower scene in Alfred
            Hitchcock’s Psycho (1960) is one of the most iconic movie scenes in cinema history, constructed from over 70
            shots, the scene shows Marion Crane the supposed protagonist meeting the end by the cross-dressing murderer
            Norman Bates only 30 minutes into the movie. The transgressive violence and scenes nudity helped to make the
            scene stand out without actually showing it.  The scene frightened viewers when it came out and to this day
            it still has the power to shock.
        </p>

        <p> Psycho helped establish further Hitchcock as a director, In 1970 Saul bass who did the title sequence for
            Psycho claimed he directed the shower scene with his proof being his storyboard showing a sequence of images
            that are similar but not exactly the same as what ended up being in the final movie.
        </p>

        <p> There has been a dispute over who actually directed this scene with Janet Leigh the actress in the shower
            scene stating” Saul Bass was there for the shooting, but he never directed me. Absolutely not. Saul Bass is
            brilliant, but he couldn’t have done the drawings had Mr. Hitchcock not discussed with him what he wanted to
            get. And you couldn’t have filmed the drawings. Why does there always have to be controversy?” it is a long
            controversy with Saul Bass and Alfred Hitchcock and I don’t really want to get into it, but it was a great
            collaboration and I can see both at work to create something impressive. (16.)
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Influence">
        <h1>Saul Bass's Influence</h1>

        <p> Saul bass as a designer has had a strong influence on
            others through his work, here are some of the ways
            he has influenced branding and visual storytelling.
        </p>
        <h3>Creating Art for Products</h3>
        <p> Saul Bass had this ability to merge artistry with commercial needs, he understood the importance of
            appealing to
            the market whilst maintaining his artistic integrity, Saul bass made sure that his designs were both
            visually
            stunning as well as commercially practical. (17.) An example of this would be Lawry’s Brand Identity which
            was
            created by Saul Bass
        </p>
        <p> Despite being a small, family owned business, Lawry had gained success through its roast beef and other
            products
            like pre-packaged seasoning to customers and so they began to compete with the giants of the food industry
            when
            they started selling on store shelves, as they gained market traction, Lawry’s felt that their logo needed
            to be
            more contemporary that would work to launch further products into national/international markets and work
            well
            on packaging. Saul Bass was initially brought on to design the dressing bottles' structural design, however
            they
            became an influential factor in the decision to develop a new logo and then they went on to develop brand
            guidelines for the company. (19.)
        </p>
        <h3>Legacy and Influence</h3>
        <p> Saul Bass has been a very influential designer, his minimalist style and emphasis on visual storytelling has
            helped influence further generations of graphic designers. His innovation and techniques have helped set new
            standards for film branding, and current designers still draw inspiration from his work, His work continues
            to
            inspire new talent in graphic design and filmmaking with his ability to show complex narratives through
            simple
            storyboards and visuals which serves as a blueprint for other artists who are hoping to make their mark as a
            designer (20.) Bass has proved that contemporary art does not have to be ornate or necessarily eye-catching,
            minimalism and adaptability can go a long way instead.
        </p>
        <h3>Modernity</h3>
        <p> Saul bass has had his legacy continued through various artists in TV Film Art etc. it just goes to show how
            influential he has been as a designer, Here are two examples of inspiration in Popular Film and TV.
        </p>
        <h4>Monsters Inc</h4>
        <p> The Monsters Inc opening title sequence is created by Geefwee Boedoe, the sequence is reminiscent of Saul
            Bass’s
            work for Around the world in eighty days and it's a Mad Mad Mad Mad world, the sequence is charming with the
            cut-out shapes and hand-drawn typography which bears a imperfection that is inviting to the viewer whilst
            removing any discomfort that a young viewer may feel after watching the slightly sinister opening scene, the
            title sequence helps reinforce that it is a comedy. (20.)
        </p>
        <h4>Mad Men</h4>
        <p> The opening for Mad Men is a stark contrast in terms of design and tone compared to Monster Inc. Designed by
            Jeremy Cox and creatively directed by Steve Fuller and Mark Gardner , the opening title features a shadowed
            figure entering his office, setting down his briefcase, then his room collapsing around him. Then it shows
            the
            figure falling through diamond rings, happy families, women in underwear, He is falling through the
            advertising
            of the 50’s. (21.)
        </p>

        <p> When Interviewed Steve Fuller had this to say “If you’re going to do something with illustration and a black
            silhouetted figure, you need to counteract that in order to keep it looking like a cartoon. We’ve seen stuff
            go
            badly because people misuse the camera in 3D. I’m a huge Saul Bass fan, but Matthew Weiner said, “I don’t
            want
            it to look like the ’60s.” I like to think that it’s kind of an update of Saul Bass.” The Mad Men title is
            an
            homage to Saul bass and his work whilst expanding upon it. (21.)
        </p>
